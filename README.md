# MobileApps-HW04

This assignment applies some of what we covered in lecture about alternate resources. In this project we provided alternate resources for devices with their language set to Spanish. We also provided layouts for both portrait and landscape device orientation.

One issue that I ran into was the color state list. In lecture, we were able to add a color resource file with a selector. However, in my project, I was not able to add a selector into a "values" file. It had to be addes as a drawable file.
